# GroundGrowing
Open Source Unity3d Planetary Terrain Generator

See the wiki on gitHub for screenshots and video.

This project is not completed, but is still usable.
This is also the working copy as well, so things
may break / change without notice as I attempt to
improve it.  There will also be notes to myself 
all throughout the code and documentation.

It currently uses the #region style organization,
so the code looks best in Visual Studio; where
the regions expand like folders.

Most interfaces are on the Editor panel in Unity,
but I recommend going through the code regardless
for now if you are seriously going to use it.

Current features include multi-threaded proceedural
terrain generation at various resolutions, using multiple
noise types that can be stacked and layered courtesy of a
C# implementation of the LibNoise Library.

TODO LIST:


*Multicore rendering off switch.

*Better fuctions to run the generator instantiated with 
variety of presets settings or files.

*Better Shaders. 

*terrain group blending.

*Custom noise inserts(e.g. gas giants, ice caps, stars.).

*Rivers city / glow overlays.

*Terrain group selection mapping. 

*Partial planet renderer that scales for rendering
ground / close up scenes (the flat mesh generator 
which is currently broken).


If there is anything else not implemented or on the TODO list that you want to suggest please let me know.  
Also feel free to ask me any questions if you have them.  
I'm easiest to reach via email:  [Richard.G.Schmidt.Jr@gmail.com]. If you do happen to 
use this in a project, please let me know and credit me.

Thanks and have fun!
